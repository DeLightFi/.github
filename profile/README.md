🚀 We are a cutting-edge organization that is all about revolutionizing decentralized finance (DeFi) on the StarkNet blockchain. Our mission is to provide users with the easiest and most efficient way to manage and track their assets, while equipping developers with the right tools to create amazing DeFi strategies.

## 🔥 Our Projects

Here at DeLightFi, we're constantly working on cutting-edge projects to push the boundaries of DeFi innovation. Check out some of our projects below:

- 📈 Starken - Your All-in-One Portfolio Tracker: Tired of juggling multiple wallets and exchanges to keep track of your crypto portfolio? Say hello to Starken! Our sleek portfolio tracker brings all your assets in one place, providing you with a clear overview of your investments, performance, and more. With a user-friendly interface and advanced analytics, managing your portfolio has never been easier.

- 💰 Morphine - DeFi layer allowing composable leverage and on-chain automation. By offering undercollateralized loans and dynamically adjusting interest rates through an on-chain rate engine, Morphine provides a high level of liquidity and less dilluted rewards for lenders, making it a valuable option to earn a passive income. Morphine's active management feature provides users with a unique experience that resembles that of centralized exchanges (CEXs) but within the DeFi space. With composable leverage to various DeFi products, users can deploy a sub-account and set automation conditions based on token prices and allocations. This allows for greater control and customization over one's DeFi portfolio and eliminates the need for manual intervention.

These are just a few of the exciting projects we're working on at DeLightFi. Stay tuned for more innovations as we continue to push the boundaries of decentralized finance and provide the best solutions for users and developers alike!
